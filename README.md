# Movie Recommendation System For Users
Build a movie recommendation system for users using the following methods:Demographic Filtering, Content Based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering

# Method Details
- Demographic Filtering: IMDB's weighted rating is used to evaluate the quality of movies. This system is used by the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) website to help viewers get an overview of the popularity and ratings of a particular work. The results returned are the top 10 movies with the highest IMDB's weighted rating

- Content Based Filtering: Recommend similar items based on a specific item. Based on the movie content (title, overview, genres, cast, keywords, tagline) to find its similarities with other movies. The general idea behind these recommendation systems is that if a person likes a particular item, he or she will also like a similar item. The results return the top 10 similar movies for each movie with the highest cosine similarity measure

- Collaborative Filtering: The basic idea of this algorithm is to predict how much a user likes an item based on other users "similar" to the existing user. Determining the "similarity" between users can be based on the level of interest (rating) of these users with other items that the system has known in the past. The results return the top 5 movies with the highest ratings based on the aggregate ratings of similar users who have watched the movies.
